About Me:
In late November of 2019, I started "Developing Android Apps with Kotlin"⁠ on Udacity; it's a 2-month-long course developed by Google itself. Fast forward 2 months later, I've had completed the course and published a personal project in the Google Play Store. My desire to work out my Android development muscles is still strong, so that brings us here!

There's this book called "The Happiness Advantage" by Shawn Achor; it states that happiness results in success, not vice versa. One lesson  I found interesting is that our perspectives can be trained. For example, hardcore Tetris players will begin to search for shapes in the real world after hours of playing. This could mean that people who tend to complain a lot are training their brains to look for the bad. An excellent example would be a software developer searching for bugs in a program, which could lead to looking for problems in the real world, like in relationships, friendships, everything. This means software developers are more prone to finding problems first instead of what's actually working. Therefore, I was inspiried to make this app in order to practice gratitude; the more you look for the good, the more positive the mind becomes.
